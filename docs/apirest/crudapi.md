# CRUD API generator 

Our API generator simplifies the process of creating APIs for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your data models. By using our API generator, you can quickly and easily create RESTful APIs to handle CRUD operations on your data models without having to write any backend code.

### To use our CRUD API generator, follow these steps:

1 - Define your data model(s). This can be done using our dashboard UI or programmatically using our SDK. <br>
2 - Generate the API for your data model(s) using our API generator. This can be done using our dashboard UI or programmatically using our SDK. <br>
3 - Use the generated API endpoints to perform CRUD operations on your data models.<br>
